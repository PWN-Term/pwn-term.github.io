## Changing extra key layout

### How to

* Its pretty straight forward,just do this.

```
// cd into eks folder
$ root && cd ../home/.pwnterm/eks

// Create backup of stock eks
$ cp default.nl default.nl.old
```

* Now to edit (For supported keys you should scroll a bit down)

```
// editing the keys list
$ nano default.nl
```

* To apply the new keys you need to restart app fully

### Supported keys list
* Adding these to eks needs you to type it as it is here, or the key wont work

```

Esc, Tab, Ctrl, Alt, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End, Up, Down, Left, Right, ..., ⌨, ▲, ▼, ◀, ▶

// Function
